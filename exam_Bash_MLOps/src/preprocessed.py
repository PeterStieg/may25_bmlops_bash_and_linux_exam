This script `preprocessed.py` retrieves data from the latest CSV file created 
in the 'data/raw/' directory.

1. It applies preprocessing to the data.
   
2. The results of the preprocessing are saved in a new CSV file 
   in the 'data/processed/' directory, with a name formatted as 
   'sales_processed_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.csv'.
   
3. All preprocessing steps are logged in the 
   'logs/preprocessed.logs' file to ensure detailed tracking of the process.

Any errors or anomalies are also logged to ensure traceability.
